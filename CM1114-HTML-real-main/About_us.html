        <h3>
            The RGU Mixology Society emerged from a shared passion and curiosity among students at Robert Gordon University (RGU) in Aberdeen. It began with casual conversations among friends who found themselves intrigued by the art and science of mixology. These conversations soon evolved into a collective desire to explore mixology further and to create a community where fellow enthusiasts could come together to learn, experiment, and share their knowledge. With a vision to blend creativity with precision, the society was founded by a small group of dedicated students who believed in the power of mixology to inspire connection and creativity. Through collaborative efforts, they organized workshops, tastings, and social events, gradually building momentum and attracting members from across campus. Fuelled by their shared enthusiasm and a commitment to fostering a vibrant mixology culture, the RGU Mixology Society flourished, becoming a beloved fixture within the university community and a testament to the transformative power of shared interests and collective ambition.

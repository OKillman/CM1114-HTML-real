        <img src="images/margarita.jpg" alt="margarita" id="margarita">
    <p>The margarita is a classic cocktail known for its refreshing taste, typically featuring tequila, lime juice, and orange liqueur. Its history is rich and colorful, with multiple theories surrounding its origin. Here's an overview of the history of the margarita:

        Early Origins: The exact origins of the margarita are somewhat disputed, with several stories and claims emerging over the years. One popular theory suggests that it was invented in the late 1930s or early 1940s. According to this theory, the cocktail was created in Mexico by a bartender named Carlos "Danny" Herrera. As the story goes, Herrera concocted the drink for a customer named Margarita Henkel, who was allergic to many spirits but enjoyed tequila. He combined tequila, lime juice, and triple sec to create the cocktail and named it after her.
        
        Another Origin Story: Another theory suggests that the margarita was created by a socialite named Margarita Sames in the late 1940s. Sames reportedly invented the cocktail during a party at her vacation home in Acapulco, Mexico. She mixed tequila, Cointreau, and fresh lime juice together, creating a drink that became an instant hit among her guests.
        
        Rise in Popularity: Regardless of its exact origin, the margarita began to gain popularity in the United States during the mid-20th century. It became especially popular in the 1950s and 1960s, thanks in part to the growing popularity of Mexican cuisine and the rise of tourism to Mexico.
        
        Variations and Adaptations: Over the years, the margarita has undergone numerous variations and adaptations. Bartenders and mixologists have experimented with different types of tequila, orange liqueurs, and fruit flavors to create unique twists on the classic recipe. Some popular variations include the frozen margarita (blended with ice), the strawberry margarita (made with fresh or frozen strawberries), and the spicy margarita (infused with jalapeño or other peppers).
        
        Cultural Impact: The margarita has become deeply ingrained in popular culture and is often associated with summertime, beach vacations, and Mexican-themed celebrations. It has appeared in countless movies, TV shows, and songs, further solidifying its status as a beloved cocktail.
        
        National Margarita Day: In recent years, National Margarita Day has been celebrated annually on February 22nd. This unofficial holiday is an opportunity for margarita enthusiasts to come together and enjoy their favorite cocktail in bars, restaurants, and homes around the world.
        
        Overall, the margarita has evolved from its humble origins into a timeless classic, beloved by cocktail enthusiasts everywhere for its delicious flavor and festive appeal. Its enduring popularity ensures that it will continue to be enjoyed for generations to come.

    <h2 id="cocktail"><b> The Recipie</b></h2>
    <p>
        <h2><b>Ingredients:</b></h2>
        <ul>
            <li> 2 ounces (60 ml) tequila</li>
            <li>1 ounce (30 ml) freshly squeezed lime juice</li>
            <li> 3/4 ounce (22.5 ml) triple sec (or Cointreau)</li>
            <li> 1/2 ounce (15 ml) simple syrup (optional, adjust to taste)</li>
            <li> Salt, for rimming the glass (optional)</li>
            <li>Ice cubes</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><b>Instructions:</b></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Glass: If you'd like a salt rim, start by rimming the edge of a margarita glass with salt. To do this, moisten the rim of the glass with a lime wedge, then dip it into a shallow dish filled with salt, rotating it to coat the rim evenly. Set the glass aside.</li>

            <li>Fill the Shaker with Ice: Fill a cocktail shaker with ice cubes. The shaker should be large enough to comfortably accommodate the ingredients and allow room for shaking.</li>
            
            <li>Add the Ingredients: Pour the tequila, freshly squeezed lime juice, triple sec, and simple syrup (if using) into the shaker.</li>
            
            <li>Shake Well: Secure the lid on the shaker and shake vigorously for about 15-20 seconds. This will thoroughly mix the ingredients and chill the margarita.</li>
            
            <li>Strain Into the Glass: Using a cocktail strainer, strain the margarita into the prepared glass over fresh ice. If you prefer your margarita without ice, you can strain it directly into the glass without ice.</li>
            
            <li>Garnish: Garnish the margarita with a lime wheel or wedge for an extra pop of color and citrus aroma. You can also add a slice of jalapeño or a sprig of fresh cilantro for a unique twist.</li>
            
            <li>Serve and Enjoy: Your classic margarita is now ready to be served! Enjoy it straight away while it's still cold and refreshing.</li>
